Image Search Project
A simple image search web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to search for images and display them on the page. It also includes a dark mode toggle for better user experience.

Features
Image Search: Users can search for images by typing a query in the input box.
Responsive Layout: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the app looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Dark Mode Toggle: Switch between dark and light modes for a personalized experience.
Hover Effects: Images have a hover effect to scale up slightly, adding interactivity to the interface.
Load More Button: A button to show more results (functionality can be added later).
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-search.git
Open the project folder in your code editor.

You can now open index.html in any browser to view the project locally.

Files Overview
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
style.css: (Optional) If you prefer to keep styles separate, this file can be linked. Otherwise, the styles are directly included in the <style> tag in the HTML file.
script.js: The JavaScript file where you can add functionality for the image search and other features.
How It Works
Dark Mode:

The dark mode toggle button changes the background and text colors to provide a darker theme. When clicked, it toggles between dark and light mode.
Search:

The user can input a search query, and it will display images. Although the functionality for fetching images from an API (like Unsplash or Pexels) is not included, it can be easily added later.
Responsive Design:

The page layout is responsive, meaning it will adjust for different screen sizes. This is achieved through CSS media queries for devices of various screen widths.
Future Enhancements
API Integration: Integrate an API (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels) to fetch real images based on the search query.
Search Pagination: Implement the "Show More" button to fetch additional results dynamically.
Accessibility Features: Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and better contrast for visually impaired users.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and content of the web page.
CSS3: Styling of the page, including responsive design and animations.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity to the page (e.g., dark mode toggle).
